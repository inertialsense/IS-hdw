# Hardware Design Files

The Inertial Sense hardware design files are made available to facilitate product hardware development and integration.

 - **PCB Libraries** - Schematic and layout files for printed circuit board designs.
 - **Products** - 3D models and resources for the uINS, Rugged, EVB, and products useful for CAD and circuit board designs.
 - [EVB-2 Evaluation Board](https://github.com/inertialsense/IS-hdw-EVB2) - Development board which contains the Inertial Sense µINS, µAHRS, or µIMU module. The EVB-2 builds on the foundation established by the EVB-1, but adds these and other new features:
   - 915MHz Xbee radio for RTK (real-time-kinematics)
   - Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Low energy (BLE) for remote data viewing and logging operation
   - Onboard logging to micro SD card.
   - Dual antenna ports for GPS compassing
   - Companion Microchip SAME70 processor that serves as a communication bridge between the µINS, µAHRS, or µIMU and all other interfaces.
