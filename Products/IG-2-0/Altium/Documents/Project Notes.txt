IS-IG-r2.0.0 Project Notes   (- to do, + done, x skipped)

________________________________________________________________________________

Changes for r2.0.1 (Future)
- Expose GPX-1 serial port pins on IG pads so GPX can be accesse IF IMX5 is not
  loaded.
- Separate reset lines between IMX5 and GPX1 so SWD debug interfaces aren't tied
  together.
- Consider adding GPX-1 SPI to LGA pads.  
- Consider adding shunt resistor to GPX-1 power.
- Space tag-connect debug connnectors further appart so we can use both ports
  at the same time.
- Fix version number on the silkscreen.
