IS-IG-r2.0.1 Project Notes   (- to do, + done, x skipped)

________________________________________________________________________________

Changes for r2.0.3 (Future)
- Consider making switching regulator configurable via jumper for 1.8V output.
  This could also be done by changing the resistor divider.
- Consider adding the JTAG header (either SMD default style or tag connect with
  locking pins.
- Add pull-up resistor on GPS reset line so that GPS will be disabled won't
  interfer with bootloader update.  Alternatively, the IMX could assert the
  GPS reset during bootloader update.
- Add missing GPX I/O pints to IG-2 SMT pins: USB, chip erase (boot mode). 

________________________________________________________________________________

Changes for r2.0.2 (Current)
+ Add diode from 3.3V to VBAT to supply VBAT when powered (if USB is used or
  VBAT is not supplied).
+ Add 1-2uF cap to VBAT to suppress transients when main power is cut.

________________________________________________________________________________

Changes for r2.0.1
+ Expose GPX-1 serial port pins on IG pads so GPX can be accesse IF IMX5 is not
  loaded.
+ Separate reset lines between IMX5 and GPX1 so SWD debug interfaces aren't tied
  together.
+ Connected TRACE/SWO from lines to debugger interface and IMX and GPX.
+ Consider adding GPX-1 SPI to LGA pads.
x Consider adding shunt resistor to GPX-1 power.
+ Space tag-connect debug connnectors further appart so we can use both ports
  at the same time.  Ideal spacing is 5.5mm.
+ Fix version number on the silkscreen.
