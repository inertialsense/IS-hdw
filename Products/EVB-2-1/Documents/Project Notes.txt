IS-EVB r2.1.2 Project Notes   (- to do, + done, x skipped)

________________________________________________________________________________

Changes for r2.1.3 (future version)
+ Configure EVB-2 to support 2nd external GNSS and not CAN.  We can't support
  both at the same time.  No load U5 and load R17 and R18.
- Update IMX footprint (using either uINS-3.2 or uINS-4.0).  Pads are slightly
  different.
- Add weak pull-up resistor to U2B pin 6 (net M-G2/RXD1/TIOB1_INV) to prevent
  floating input.

________________________________________________________________________________

Changes for r2.1.2
+ Fix the I2C line (SDA, SCL) reversal on EVB-2 SAME70.

________________________________________________________________________________

Changes for r2.1.1
+ Move TIOA1 (TC input) pin from GPIO1 to GPIO9 for measuring encoder velocity
  on to GPIO9 (multi-tie).  We would not like to have to tie GPIO9 and GPIO3
  together offboard the EVB-2 for wheel encoder input.  We share the QDEC and
  TC input on the same line for angle and velocity measurement.
+ Consider adding a TC input to each of the QDEC channel A lines so all wheel
  encoder inputs support velocity measurement.
+ Add second CAN transceiver from EVB E70 to H2 and remove CAN jumper.  We can
  share H2 with uINS and EVB-E70.  Connect transceivers disable line to jumper
  or EVB disable line.
+ Enlarge fiducials from 0.76mm to 1.0mm on both sides.

________________________________________________________________________________

Changes for r2.1.0
+ Dual purpose reset line to reset uINS and MCU using an RC filters.  One resets
  quickly and the other follows after a delay.
+ Consider loading ICE debugger header for SAME70 MCU by default to support
  developers.
+ Expose uINS data ready pin GPIO13 on H7.
+ Fix top layer copper pour for XBee regulator input that connects C20 pin 2 to
  XBee regulator U7 pin 1.
+ Cut trace (disconnect) VUSB from ESD protection for both USB ports.  It's
  causing voltage to appear on FET switches and partially enable.
+ Add EVB version number to PCB
+ Consider switching battery to Seiko MS621T for -40 to 85 C temp range.
X Consider Seiko SC-20S for 32.768 KHz crystal. Is it better?
+ Add jumper selection of CAN tranceiver to uINS and EVB processor for CAN
  support.
+ Consider exposing SAME70 chip erase (PB12) to SMT resistor pads to 3.3V.
+ Fix reversed uINS CAN Rx and Tx lines.  (Double check this).

________________________________________________________________________________

Changes for r2.0.1
X Consider adding a battery management IC.
+ Add inverted bold labels for I/O headers.
+ Reverse the H1 power pin order so pin 1 is positive and pin 2 ground.
+ Add fiducials to help SMT machine alignment.
+ Invert and increase label size for I/O headers so they are easier to read.
+ Move to new button style
+ Fit shorter U.FL cables
+ Fix error that applied H1 voltage to the USB port in the power schematic
+ Remove or fix XBee USB power FET logic (Q3).
+ Remove R51 and connect with trace.
+ Fix RX line of XOR gate.
+ Add version label.
+ Update manufacturing docs for new U.FL cables (current cables are good)
X Consider removing second micro USB connector and use a USB switch instead. We
  could use Microchip USB2422 or similar. Extra space freed up can be used for
  battery circuitry.
+ Jumper to G1_SDA and G2_SCL to CAN transciever to support future generation
  of uINS which will have new processor with CAN stack. 
+ Consider consolidating the power input FET arrays
+ Move INS reset from common reset to MCU pin.
+ Move voltage sensing circuit to analog capable pin of MCU instead of on INS.
+ Connect QDEC2 and QDEC4 lines to H8 so we can support 3 quadrature encoders.
x Add pull-up or pull-down resistors on serial Rx lines (or enable SAME70) for
  TTL serial.  (Not necessary. Both SAME70 and SP330 already includes these.)
+ Move to 0.0033uF caps on SS/TR lines on voltage regulators to bring rise time
  into spec.

________________________________________________________________________________

Changes for r2.0
+ parts: ATSAMS70, ATWINC3400-MR210UA122
+ WiFi/BT power down
+ Radio power down
+ XOR gate on GPIO serial port for hobby SBUS input.
+ Put chip erase on semi-convenient pads that can be shorted together.
+ SPI config enable pin on uINS should be controlled by MCU.
+ Consider adding dual LEDs for communications status for XBee and WINC.
+ Consider adding MOSFETs instead of two diodes to prioritize the USB power
  source to elimiate forward voltage drop and power loss.
+ Ensure MCU USB OTG ID detect is connected.
+ Consider making buttons vertical.
+ LED: uINS com, XBee, Wifi, Log/status (tri color).
X Add blue color line to communications LEDs IF there is room.
+ Move LED traces to closest PADs for easier routing.  Keep status/log on PWM.
+ Add series termination resistors inline with serial lines between Xbee and
  MCU.
X Do Xbee Tx/Rx pins go into tristate when powered down.  If not, we need a switch for
  radio data lines to connector.
X Do we need the RTS and CTS pins on the external radio header? If so, consider
  moving back to XBee serial. (We don't)
+ Equalize SD card trace lengths.
+ Double check USB pair spacing and trace lengths.
+ Reconsider whether we should share a common reset pin between uINS and MCU.
  (Jumper)
+ Run ground plane on L2 just below WiFi RTC trace.
+ Add SPI flash chip to uINS.  Use Micron# MT29F2G01ABAGDWB-IT:G TR
  (Digikey# 557-1664-1-ND) Datasheet is here:
  https://www.dropbox.com/s/32wbtqslqhy62je/m79a_2gb_3v_nand_spi.pdf?dl=0
  Dropbox (Inertial Sense)\IS Shared\Datasheets Manuals\Memory - Flash\NAND\m79a_2gb_3v_nand_spi.pdf
  Also added footprint for SOIC-8 memory chips
+ Add CAN jumpers to uINS (for future rev that has onboard CAN).  Use I2C pins
  on uINS.
+ Double check pin directions for serial ports and flow control (CTS, RTS) is
  correct.  Crossovers are needed.
X Consider adding 2 more GPIO pins to SAME70 GPIO header to fill the last two
  empty pins.
+ Check chip select for FLASH chip (added pullup)
+ Identify another RS232/422/485 chip. The one currently on the board only has
  2000 pieces in stock at digikey, is out of stock everywhere else. (SP330)
+ Add decoupling caps between 3.3V and GND planes at high speed digital layer
  transitions.
+ Consider connecting GPS timepulse pin to SAME70
X Consider connecting USB ID pin to uINS through jumper.
+ Check ATSAME70 part number
+ Push button on strobe pin? (control via software)
+ Add ground fence and reinforce connector GND planes
+ Cutback copper pour around GPS and 900MHz RF connectors.
+ Larry thinks non-threaded standoffs would be more versatile.
+ Removed copper below ATWINC BLE WiFi device so we have the option to use the
  integrated antenna module.
x Consider adding a board cutout for the ATWINC.  There's room.
+ Add U.FL cable install instructions (use picture of the real thing!).

________________________________________________________________________________

Changes for r1.4
X Headers for both serial ports (alternate LoRa radio and when USB is not
  connected.
X Power header/connector if USB is not used.
X Add SD card.
x Add SAMA5D27_SOM1 as embedded computer.
+ Ensure GPS timepulse on uINS pin 20 is tied to a header for access.
X Reversing Molex pin order so pin 1 matches Molex labels.  (This causes
  customers problems).
+ Add +3.3V and +5V (and extra grounds) on dev interface to power external
  devices.
+ Add H122039-ND CABLE ASSEM UFL-UFL 35MM 0.81 to BOM.
X Move connectors out of way of uINS pads so we can solder/desolder the uINS w/o
  removing the connectors. (We don't want to support removing uINS from EVB)
X Consider configuring the connector pinouts so that Tx and Rx are always the
  same pins, that way we can swap connectors and still get connectivity.
X Invert USB connector so USB-B label faces up.  Either get inverted style or
  move to the bottom of the board.
X Remove JTAG header and reset button.
X Add CAN bus interface back.
+ Change JTAG (SWD) connector pinout to use the SAM port not AVR, on the
  ATMELICE debugger.
+ Add solder paste back to uINS pads (so we can more quickly assemble the uINS).
X Get uINS to SMD reflow capability.  Assemble all headers.
+ Remove kapton tape from under the uINS.
+ Remove voltage divider to FTDI reset pin.  This is no longer necessary since
  we moved the FTDI VCC from +3.3V to USB.VBUS.  It used to be that this voltage
  divider would hold the device in a tri-state mode if no USB connection was
  present.  Now the device is entirely off.
+ Switch micro USB connector to through hole version to prevent pop-offs.
  Amphenol# 10118194-0001LF or Molex# 1050170001
+ Add 2nd GPS antenna connector (GPS compassing support).
+ Add Zigbee U.FL and SMA connector
X Espressif ESP32 Wifi/BT chip - move micro SD card to it?
+ Consider side actuating button:
    https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/panasonic-electronic-components/
    EVQ-P7J01P/P16767CT-ND/4429460
x Switch SMA connectors to rugged INS style RF connectors to save space.
X Switch back to AB USB connector so we can use the device as a master or a slave.
X Consider including ethernet port (ESP32 has support for it). External PHY and code is available,
  part number is LAN8720. Maybe better would be to use the ethernet if we are making a test bed
  networking board.
+ Fix chip select on SPI bus
+ Consider adding Pi SPI bus (MOSI, MISO, CLK, CS) to GPIO header.
X Consider adding wifi RP-SMA connector (not needed, range is pretty good)
X Consider integrating power header pins into comm header
+ Ensure the USB interface on the INS works or consider adding switch to connect
  Serial port on INS to Pi UART
+ Remove alignment pins for uINS
+ Add way to disable radio and plug in own radio
+ Removed uINS solder paste.
+ Consider moving Xbee radio Tx/Rx LEDs from FTDI to Tx/Rx lines using FETs.
x Consider adding another USB switch to switch INS between slave USB on hub
  and master on USB host post
x Consider adding third FTDI chip to connect uINS to USB hub in case USB driver
  falls through.
+ Decide to use 5mm or 6mm standoffs for compute module. (We chose 5mm).
+ Add RP-SMA part number and description for XBee part.
+ Consider adding notch for WiFi U.FL coax to route to 2nd GPS SMA connector...
+ Ensure all active parts have at least one 10nF decoupling cap.
+ Change board standoffs (non-Pi) to correct height.
+ Consider adding additional AP2331 to host USB port to prevent reset of RPi
  when device plugged in.
+ Confirm that varistor is rated correctly.
x Can we add Pi PWM to header to drive servo motors?  Would be nice to have 4
  PWM.  Maybe we can double up I/O to get this.
+ Method to disable Xbee radio? SMD power jumper?
+ Add dedicated oscilator so we don't have to do anything special on the PI.
  Consider using SiTime# SIT1533AI-H4-DCC-32.768E ($1, 2x1.2mm).
  Added a different part from the WiFi shield
+ Ensure that the USB interface to the uINS still works even if Pi power supply
  is not present.  (i.e. if H1 is not connected, the uINS and USB interface
  should still work).  Supply 3.3V (INS.3V3) to FTDI devices as long as it
  doesn't effect performance.
+ Fix H2 pin order - try to arrage so we get GPIO numbering in order.
x Reconsider need for XBee full handshake UART, add jumper to INS GPIO for DTR
  so it can program
+ Switching USB ESD protection to TI# TPD2EUSB30DRTR.
+ Reinforce SMD headers with copper pour to prefent them from tearing off.
X Change XBee power switch to MCU control?
+ Check JTAG pinouts

Items to test before fabrication:
- Ability to reconfigure Xbee modems through uINS.  Do we need to connect DTR for this?
