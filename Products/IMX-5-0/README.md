![IMX-5](Images/IMX_5.0_400w.jpg)

The Inertial Sense µIMU is a miniature calibrated Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), Attitude Heading Reference System (AHRS), and GNSS aided Inertial Navigation System (GNSS-INS) with sensor fusion to estimate roll, pitch, heading, velocity, and position.  GNSS receivers are not included onboard the µIMU module.

  - **Accel: 19 µg Bias Instability, 0.02 m/s/√hr VRW**
- **High Accuracy INS (w/ IMX-5):  0.03° Roll/Pitch, 0.1° Dynamic Heading** 
- Surface Mount Reflowable (PCB Module)
- Up to 1KHz IMU and INS Output Data Rate
- Small Form Factor:  15.6 x 12.5 x 2.9 mm
- Light Weight:  0.8 g
- Low power consumption:  <110mW
- External GNSS Support (Multi-Band)
- Attitude (Roll, Pitch, Yaw, Quaternions), Velocity, and Position UTC Time Synchronized
- Triple Redundant IMUs Calibrated for Bias, Scale Factor, Cross-axis Alignment, and G-sensitivity
- -40°C to 85°C Sensor Temperature Calibration
- Binary and NMEA ASCII Protocol
- Barometric Pressure and Humidity
- Strobe In/Out Data Sync (Camera Shutter Event) 
- Fast Integration with SDK and Example Software
