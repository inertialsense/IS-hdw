# IMX-5

![IMX-5](Images/IMX_5.0_400w.jpg)

The **IMX-5**™ is a 10-DOF sensor module consisting of a tactical grade Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), magnetometer, and barometer. Output includes angular rate, linear acceleration, magnetic vector, and barometric pressure and altitude. IMU calibration consists of bias, scale factor, cross-axis alignment, and temperature compensation. The IMX-5 includes Attitude Heading Reference System (**AHRS**) sensor fusion to estimate roll, pitch, and heading. Adding GNSS input to the IMX-5 enables onboard Inertial Navigation System (**INS**) sensor fusion for roll, pitch, heading, velocity, and position.
